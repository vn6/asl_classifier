Hello!
=========

This is a project I'm starting now (Feb 3, 2018)
Hopefully it works out.  My goal is to create a **sign language classifier** which will:
- take in realtime sign langauge data
-translate it using a neural network classifier
-train it using exisiting online data & videos (of sign langauge, ofc!)

I'm pretty much doing this for fun and also to practice some machine learning things.  Hopefully it wokrs out and maybe I'll be able to monetize it osmetime.
